# PythonRayCasting

Simple Ray-Casting engine written in PyGame.

## Description

This project was inspired by PyRay project and enriched by new ideas and some math simplifications. I rewrote this engine for educational purposes (high school students) - I simplified the math where I could (having the same or very similar user experience), adjusted the code to our class guideliness and added few additional features like strifing, additional shadows for far away objects or game speed adjustments.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3.x (tested on 3.9)
* PyGame 2.0.1 compatible version


### Executing program

* Just run main.py

## Help

* W / Up - go forward
* S / Down - go backward
* Q / Left - turn left
* E / Right - turn right
* A - strafe left
* D - strafe right

There's no real goal of this game.
